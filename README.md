# Java-IterativeAStar

This was the third project for ICS340 (Algorithms and Data Structures), an iterative deepening A* search. 

In this, we were provided the graph, goal and heuristic files, as well as some of the basic graph functionality. We needed to finish constructing the application to find the lowest cost path from start to goal.
